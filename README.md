🧠 Decision Making
-------------
This section outlines the rationale behind key architectural and UX decisions made during the
development of this application.

🏗️ **Architecture**:

 - **Clean Architecture + MVVM** \
  Ensures clear separation of concerns across layers: UI, Domain, and Data. Each layer has a
  well-defined responsibility, improving testability and maintainability.

 - **Modularization** \
  Even though the app requirements are simple, the project is modularized to support scalability.
  This allows different features to be developed in isolation without conflicts, making the codebase
  future-proof and team-friendly.

 - **Single Activity with Jetpack Compose & Navigation Compose** \
  The app uses a single-activity architecture, with features separted into submodules. This
  centralizes navigation and simplifies lifecycle handling across screens.
  Even if there is only one feature now, Navigation will help for future growth of the project.

🚀 Future Improvements
---------------
Some planned or possible enhancements:

**Improve image loading performance** \
Currently the time to load each image is still high.

**Support Build variants** \
Due to time constraint, I don't have enough time to support build variance but it will be a good
improvements in the future.

**Improve Code quality**
